# Thresholdgraph Algorithm

+++

In this tutorial, we will explore Threshold Graphs algorithm and its implementation in NetworkX under [`networkx/algorithms/threshold.py`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/threshold.py).

## Import package

```{code-cell}
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Definitions

A graph G is a threshold graph if there exists a threshold function $w:V(G)→Z^+$ such that for every pair of vertices 
u and v in $G,uv ∈ E(G)$ if and only if $w(u) + w(v) ≥ k$, where k is a fixed threshold value.

## Properties

**Induced Subgraphs**:Any induced subgraph of a threshold graph is also a threshold graph. This property is known as heredity.

**Recognition**:Threshold graphs can be recognized in linear time. There exists a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a given graph is a threshold graph or not.

**Threshold Characterization**:A graph is a threshold graph if and only if it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to $P_4$(the path on 4 vertices), $C_4$(the cycle on 4 vertices), or $2K_2$(two disconnected edges). This characterization simplifies the recognition process.

**Perfect Graph**:Threshold graphs are a subclass of perfect graphs. Perfect graphs have a strong connection with various combinatorial optimization problems and have efficient algorithms for many of them.

## Applications

**Social Networks**:Threshold graphs can model relationships in social networks where connections between individuals depend on a certain level of mutual interests or interactions.

**Resource Allocation**:Threshold graphs are used in resource allocation problems where resources are allocated to tasks based on a threshold criterion. For example, assigning tasks to workers based on skill levels.

**Biological Networks**:Threshold graphs can model certain biological networks, such as metabolic networks, where the presence or absence of certain compounds or reactions depends on threshold concentrations.
